	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures how the duration of a process changes with varying input sizes. Efficient algorithms aim to have low time complexity, ensuring faster performance even as the input size increases.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> evaluates the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. An algorithm with space complexity of O(n) requires memory that grows linearly with the input size, indicating efficient use of space as the input expands.</p>
