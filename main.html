	<h1>Time Space and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures how the duration of a process changes with varying input sizes, and efficient algorithms aim for low values, ensuring faster performance even as the input size increases.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> evaluates the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size, and an algorithm with O(n) requires memory that grows linearly, indicating efficient use of space as the input expands.</p>
